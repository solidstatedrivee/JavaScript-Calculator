# JavaScript-Calculator
A project I decided to do because I was putting too many hours into Breath of the Wild ðŸ˜‚. It's also a personal goal of mine to create more apps. This is a simple web application calculator that runs on JavaScript. It was a good opportunity to brush up my skills with CSS grid. I also used the powerful switch case statement for the first time here. 


You can demo the project [here](https://solidstatedrivee.github.io/JavaScript-Calculator/).
